    "solution": "The current onAddToCart function is throwing an error which is causing the application to crash. To resolve this issue, the simulated error throw should be removed, and the original cart.addItem(data) function call should be reinstated. This will restore the intended functionality of adding items to the shopping cart. The file to modify: components/info.tsx, check the logic around cart.addItem(data); ",
